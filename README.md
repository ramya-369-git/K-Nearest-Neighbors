# K-Nearest Neighbors on Diabetes Dataset

This repository contains a supervised machine learning project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify diabetes outcomes based on diagnostic measurements.

## 📁 Contents

- `code.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook implementing KNN with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `diabetes.csv` — Dataset used in the analysis.
- `.gitignore` — Git ignore file for cleaner version control.

## 🧠 Project Objective

- Understand and implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- Apply KNN to a real-world dataset (diabetes prediction).
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Compare KNN's results with other supervised learning methods (optional).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains diagnostic measurements for patients, such as:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (1 = diabetes, 0 = no diabetes)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `scikit-learn` for model building
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
